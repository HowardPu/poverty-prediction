### Project Description
* What is the overarching purpose of your research project, and why is it an important undertaking?
> 

* How does your research fit into the broader problem domain? You should cite at least 3 papers that help contextualize your research. 
> 

* What specific hypothesis (hypotheses) are you going to test?
> 

* What are the datasets you'll be working with to answer this question? Please include relevant background describing the datasets you identify.
>

* What statistical and machine learning methods do you plan on using to test your hypothesis?
>

* Who is your target audience for the resource you will build? Depending on the domain of your data, there may be a variety of audiences interested in using the dataset. You should hone in on one of these audiences.
>

* What should your audience learn from your resource? Consider specific questions they may want to answer.
> 

### Technical Description

* What will be the format of your final web resource?
> We decide to use HTML pages to build our final report. We believe, as HTML is more flexible compared with other options such as RMarkdown or Shiny, HTML may have more efficiency to visualize data and display graphs.

* Do you anticipate any specific data collection / data management challenges?
> A few challenges must exist in data management. The first challenge is that we learned to utilize R or Python to manipulate data in class. It means that we have few experience in dealing with data by JavaScript language. Another challenge is that data visualization techniques in JavaScript may not be the same as those in Python/R. In other words, we require extensive research on those exploratory data analysis library to build an interactive report.

* What new technical skills will need to learn in order to complete your project?
> Given those challenges, we believe the following aspects are required for succeeding in this project. The first one is to learn new libraries for data management in JavaScript to clean and prepare the data for further data visualization. And the second aspect is that we should do some research about data visualization tools in Javascript.

* How will you conduct you analysis? Please include a detailed description of your intended modeling approach. 
> For exploratory data analysis, the manipulation of data will be done in Javascript/React. For such manipulation, we found “js-dataframe” and “lodash” is useful to wangle the data. For statistical analysis and machine learning process, most of the work will be done in Python. The logistical modeling will be done in “statsmodels” and “sklearns” as we learned both of them in INFO 370.
    
* What major challenges do you anticipate? 
> As we mentioned before, the first challenge is that we do not learn data wrangling and visualization through HTML in class and we need extra time to learn these skills. Another challenge is that we utilize various programming languages such as R, Python and HTML in this project. It will increase the burden of debugging and testing as they are in different platforms and in different syntaxes.
